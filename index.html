            With the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing, many people are looking at
            a lot of free time stuck indoors. Avoid cabin fever and use that
            time to make a difference in your community and the fight against

          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the hackathon ultimately isn’t to win prizes, it’s to
            build useful apps that people can use to manage and survive during
            the COVID-19 pandemic Like the COVID-19 situation the hackathon
            resources and structure will change as time goes on!
          </p>

            The first prize (called the first responder prize) will be awarded
            <strong>March 24th</strong> and there will be many more to come!

              <h4>How big can teams be?</h4>
              <p>
                Up to 5 people, if you're looking to submit your project for the
                weekly and/or final prizes. Otherwise, we don't really mind if
                you go over, so as long as your project sits out from prizing
                considerations!

            <section>
              <h4>What about Intellectual Property (IP)?</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The intellectual property of each project is owned by their
                  respective teams.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Teams that use someone else's assets (e.g. libraries,
                  frameworks, source code, images, etc.) are responsible for
                  abiding by each asset's usage rights. Failure to do so will
                  <strong>automatically disqualify</strong> that team from
                  current and future prize consideration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In case it wasn't clear, no stealing of others' intellectual
                  property! Be 100% sure you are allowed to use something before
                  you do.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While not required during submission, teams must be ready to
                  provide proof of fair use of intellectual property to judges
                  and organizers upon request.
                </li>

            <section>
              <h4>Does our solution need to be open-source?</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>No, not necessarily.</li>
                <li>
                  For teams that choose to keep their solution proprietary,
                  judges and organizers reserve the right to scrutinize the
                  source code & other assets for compliance with usage rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For all teams, failure to allow judges' and organizers'
                  scrutiny may result in disqualification from prizing of any
                  nature.

                That's fine, however only projects that were started
                <strong>on or after March 17, 00:00 UTC</strong> can be

                  - Participants understand that this is a charitable event
                  organized by volunteers with limited resources and time. As
                such, participants understand that a best effort will be made to
                ensure fairness and equality in the judging and awarding of
                  prizes. Participants accept that prizes will be awarded at the
                  discretion of the judges, sponsors, and organizers. By
                participating all participants agree to accept the decisions of
                the judges, sponsors and organizers, and waive all rights to
                pursue legal or other recourse against the event, organizers,
                judges, sponsors, partners, or other parties should a dispute
                arise.
